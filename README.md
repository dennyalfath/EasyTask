# EasyTask
Example Project with Sign In With Apple Feature Applied

## Overview and Story Behind
As we develop app, login system is one of the useful component to be added. In some cases, we need user to log in because there are features available
when they are logged in. It can be in any cases actually, especially if we are going to make an app that related to interaction of users. Because of that, i think
this is need to be learnt as soon as i can. In order to use it later when i develop my own app or maybe our groups in next challenge.
